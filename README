This example provide ‘a basis’to make a game like angry birds or something similar. 

This mini game is made with Platino Engine, a cross-platform (iOS and Android) game engine which uses JavaScript and runs on the Titanium framework. 

Edited: I just discovered some problems related to physics (only in Android) with the new version of Platino 2.5. (Subject to review)
